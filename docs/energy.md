# Energy

Energy provides “skin in the game” and a measurement of verification potential for Aura players. The use of multiple [flavors](https://elated-murdock-5004e1.netlify.app/docs/energy#energy-flavors) of energy provides an avenue for [decentralization](https://elated-murdock-5004e1.netlify.app/docs/goals#decentralized).

## Energy sources

A team of sybil defenders can create an energy source and brand it, turning it into a new flavor of energy. A small fee paid in $Bright[^1]  prevents spamming new energy flavors.

The energy team that controls the source restarts each analysis round with all the energy of that flavor. It then flows as [allocated by Aura players](https://elated-murdock-5004e1.netlify.app/docs/how-aura-works#the-aura-social-graph)[^2].

### Energy team management

Members of an energy team manage themselves. It takes a two-thirds majority vote to add or remove an energy team member.

Only energy team members start with energy at the beginning of analysis rounds. Energy then flows downstream to recipients managed by allocating energy through the Aura interface.

## Energy Flavors

Each energy source has its own flavor, and its flow is independently calculated.

Players choose up to five[^3]  energy flavors for their personal energy composition. Energy received by a player in a flavor not in their composition is absorbed (not passed on).

Apps choose verification methods that include one or more energy flavors in their analysis. Only included flavors can help players verify other users.

Flavors therefore compete with each other for usage by players and apps.

## Rewarding Aura Players

Each flavor of energy comes with a reward bucket to which anyone can add $Bright to be regularly distributed[^4] to players proportional to the amount of that flavor of energy they hold.

This system provides an easy way to pay for effective sybil protection by Aura players.

App creators can sponsor the best players by adding rewards to high quality energy flavors that factor into the analysis methods they use.

Creators or early proponents of a new energy flavor can add to its reward bucket to encourage early adoption by players.

[^1]: Fees are paid to the non-profit fund for Aura research and development.
[^2]: Via power iterations as in [SybilRank](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi12/technical-sessions/presentation/cao).
[^3]: This integer is a global Aura constant that can be adjusted based on real-world analysis.
[^4]: The depositor determines the flow rate of the reward. For example, they could deposit 1000 $Bright to be distributed over 10 days. A small percentage of the reward is sent as a fee to the non-profit Aura fund to pay for the maintenance of the reward system and Aura’s research and development. Early depositors could be rewarded via [attention streams](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TKA-K8YadRdgz-Qek01TUcCkRaI9CKCXGtJ31AbVWIU/edit#heading=h.c8wdt9uwyj7r).
