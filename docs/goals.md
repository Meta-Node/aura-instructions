# Goals of Aura

## Sybil battleground

Aura hosts the best motivated, best [equipped](https://elated-murdock-5004e1.netlify.app/docs/verification#verification-tools), and most capable sybil defenders. Sybil defense moves from casual BrightID users to elite Aura players. Sybil attackers are forced to target highly skilled Aura players rather than BrightID users.

Aura players have â€œskin in the game". Mistakes by professional players cost them [future earning potential](https://elated-murdock-5004e1.netlify.app/docs/energy#rewarding-aura-players).

## Decentralized

Aura is resilient against fraud. If an [energy flavor](https://elated-murdock-5004e1.netlify.app/docs/energy#energy-flavors) becomes corrupted, other flavors are waiting to take its place. The market for apps needing uniqueness verification determines which flavors are the most valuable.

## Scalable

The economics of Aura drive global scalability. Apps seeking to expand into regions lacking verification can [reward energy flavors](https://elated-murdock-5004e1.netlify.app/docs/energy#rewarding-aura-players) that cover those regions. On a local level, the need for BrightID verification drives well-connected users to learn to become Aura players.
